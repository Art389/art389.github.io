            <h1>Art's Monthly Newsletter - October 2024</h1>
        </div>
        <h2><blockquote>Hello, Artur fans!</blockquote></h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
         <p>Welcome to the October edition of Artur's newsletter. The start of October has been very eventful for Artur. Artur recently got more hours for his job, which will allow him to save up more money for his trip in December. The trip in December is a huge event Artur is looking forward to because he gets to go out of state to see his friends in Minnesota. Minnesota is also the state Artur was born in and grew up in most of his life. Furthermore, the December trip will be amazing for Artur since he gets to experience snow again after not being able to for years.</p>
         
         <h3>Monthly Goals</h3>
         <p>There aren't many goals for this month but Artur still plans on having a set of goals for each month.</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Get started on projects for IT</li>
            <li>Step up the level of intensity within the gym</li>
            <li>Keep pressure washing as a side gig</li>
            <li>Start assignments earlier</li>

         </ol>

         <h3>Final conclusion</h3>
         <p>There truly isn't a lot for me to report on for Artur's life in the month of October. Its not because Artur's life is uneventful its mostly because its only been a week into October and not much has occured for Artur.</p>
